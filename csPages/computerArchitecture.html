    <h1>Computer Architecture</h1>
    </header>

    
   <section class="content"> 

    <p>Computer architecture is a general term for the hardware of computers, or the physical parts of a computer. These are the parts of the computer that can be seen with your eyes. There are many different parts that make up a computer.
  </p>
    
    <h2>Motherboard</h2>
    <p>The motherboard is a circuit board that computer components use to communicate through. It’s like the glue that holds everything in the computer together, and it also contains some other small parts of the computer. </p>
    
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <p>Input devices send external information to the computer. Some input devices are a keyboard, a mouse, a game controller, and a webcam.
  </p>
    
    <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>Output devices are components that the computer uses to send information to its user. Some examples of output devices include a projector, a monitor, a printer, speakers, and headphones.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Storage devices are used by the computer to store information. Hard drives and CDs are storage devices.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>USB (Universal Series Bus) flash drives, also known as thumb drives and USB sticks, are portable plug-in storage devices.</li>
      <li>The RAM (Random Access Memory) is a storage part with a volatile memory, which means that it gets erased every time the computer restarts. It stores data regarding frequently accessed programs, and it helps apps start up and close fast.
  </li>
      <li>An HDD (Hard Disk Drive) is an actual disk that stores data, and it’s read by a mechanical arm.</li>
      <li>An SSD (Solid State Drive) is a storage device similar to an HDD except for the fact that it has no moving parts, and it’s faster than an HDD since it doesn’t spend time waiting for a mechanical arm to find data on a physical location.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Processors</h2>
    <p>Processors run programs, interpret input, and supply output.
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer, and it has a direct connection to the motherboard. It receives input and carries out commands from other hardware and software. The CPU breaks down instructions given by a peson into a language the processor can understand, assembly language.
  </li>
      <li>The GPU (graphics processing unit) is the graphics card, and it delivers images, animations, and videos that can be viewed on a computer screen. It communicates directly with the display monitor.</li>
    </ul>
